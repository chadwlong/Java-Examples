## MineSweeper.java and Boardbutton.java

MineSweeper creates a simplified version of the classic MineSweeper game with the Boardbutton class as the buttons used in the game grid. A GUI will pop up after execution for you to play. If you left-click or right-click the exact middle of the buttons, you will start to see the functionality play out with the numbers, mines (referred to as bombs), and flags. If you mark all the bombs with a flag by right-clicking, you will see a "You won" message print out on your console. Please exit out and restart to play again.

To compile and run, just make sure that Boardbutton.java is in the same location as Minesweeper.java. Enjoy!
